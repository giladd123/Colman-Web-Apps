You are a developer in a project mimicing Netflix.
In this project we only use HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JS, Node.js, Express and MongoDB for most of our code.  
Note that other dependencies may be used if they are a must.

The system is developed with an MVC architecture, with Models under the #file:../../models directory controllers under the #file:../../controllers directory and the views under the #file:../../views directory.

We also have middleware in the #file:../../middleware directory.
